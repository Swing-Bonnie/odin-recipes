<p>Duck, although not the most popular protein is without a doubt my favorite.
    This recipe will show you a way to take the pesky waterfowl, and turn into into something delicious.
    The prep time may take while I can tell you for sure it will be worth it.
    Hopefully you and whoever else you make this for can gain a new appreciation for duck!
